this app will teach you scales and chords on an alternative design of a piano keyboard.


while playing the piano, you may change the scale you currently use. the yellow rectangle would mark the current scale and above notes in the scale would appear the letter a or b. it is reccomended to go through the toturial first to understand the purposes of the a or b marking of the notes within the current scale.

you may click  with your mouse on notes or use your keyboard. letter a is the musical note c(do). letter s is the musical note D(re).. up to the letter j that is the musical note A(la).

currently only one octave is availble, that is the middle octave of the piano.
